ValidatorExitHelper is a program that facilitates the **exit** of Ethereum Validators from the blockchain network. It supports selecting the number of Validators to exit or choosing all, ensuring a safe exit process with confirmation before execution of irreversible commands. The program also logs important information such as Public Key and URL for future verification.

## Purpose
1. Facilitate the safe exit of multiple Validators at once.
2. Reduce human error by confirming actions before executing irreversible commands.
3. Log essential information like Public Key and URL for verifying Validator status after exiting.

## Features
- Only supports exiting Validators with `enabled: true` status.
- Allows selecting a specific number of Validators to exit, or exit all Validators.
- Verifies the success of the `lighthouse account validator exit` command and retries if the command fails.
